    "Look into multiple different resources until you find a teaching/presentation style that works for you. For example, I find \"harder\" material less difficult than \"easy\" material if its presentation is superior (e.g. less dull). There are not really any right or wrong approaches; the right approach is the one that gets you coding. Find what works for you and go with that.\n",
